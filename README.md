## Objects
There are two entities `Sign` and `Question`.
`Sign` is described by three `String` fields: `id`, `description`, and `type`.
`Question` is based on `Sign`.
It also requires Strings `question` and `answer`, and `List` of strings `answers`.

The `answer` variable is used to check if a user chooses a correct answer.

`List<String> answers` contains all possible answers for this question (one correct option, three incorrect).
They are displayed on a screen in the main activity.

Signs and questions are being parsed from `/assets/signs.json` and `/assets/questions.json` respectively.

## Program flow
#### Disclaimer (launcher activity)
A launcher activity is a disclaimer activity.
A disclaimer text is stored in a `/assets/disclaimer_text.txt` file.
The activity uses SharedPreferences to save a boolean variable whether a user accepted a disclaimer.
Obviously, you can't use the app without accepting the disclaimer.
On each run, the launcher activity checks the variable from SharedPreferences, and if it's true, it starts a main activity.

#### Signs test (main activity)
At first, this activity parses signs.
This process is pretty straightforward.
It's just a mapping of fields from JSON to POJO `Sign`.

While parsing signs, the activity also populates:
1. a list of signs `List<Sign> signs`
2. a map of ids to signs `Map<String, Sign> idSign`
3. a map of types to descriptions `Map<String, List<String>> typeToDescriptions`

Then, the activity initializes questions by parsing a respecting JSON file.
A list of answers is generated by creating a list from the correct answer and three random possible answers of the same type (`description` or `type`).
Then questions are shuffled.
And the program starts displaying them one by one.
